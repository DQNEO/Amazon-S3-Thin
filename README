Amazon::S3 is a portable client library for working with and
managing Amazon S3 buckets and keys.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make 
    make test 
    make install

TESTING
    
Testing S3 is a tricky thing. Amazon wants to charge you a
bit of money each time you use their service. And yes,
testing counts as using. Because of this, the application's
test suite skips anything approaching a real test unless you
set these three environment variables: 

AMAZON_S3_EXPENSIVE_TESTS
        
    Doesn't matter what you set it to. Just has to be set

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
        
    Your AWS access key

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET
    Your AWS sekkr1t passkey. Be forewarned that setting this
    environment variable on a shared system might leak that
    information to another user. Be careful.
